Created a RESTFUL API project that covers OOP mechanics and also uses SpringBoot and Spring Security. Used  PostgreSQL for tables. Got bored at test stage, couple of things still to be revised.
%95 of the project is done, couple methods and classes are faulty.Was going to finish it but got bored, will do a revision in the future hopefully.
